The Remote Health Monitoring dataset has 500 entries, which contain patient health metrics for all patients across various medical settings. Thus, it involves variables like heart, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, temperature, respiratory rate, and the patientâ€™s location (front line, field hospital), activity level and corresponding timestamps. Additionally, the scheme has a flag to help assess the security and reliability of remote health monitoring systems in high risk environment of quantum attacks, eavesdropping, data manipulation and injection attacks.
